[] “Hidden but not secret” encrypted vault (client-only) Encrypted payload embedded in repo; You commit vault.enc (binary/base64) to the repo. Command: vault unlock → prompts password → decrypts in-memory → allows vault cat notes.md, vault download notes.md. Nothing is sent anywhere. Wrong password yields garbage / auth fail.

[] fix: cat/open/download/verify/resume address of the file

[] fix grep to search text files + case blurbs

[] Avoid fake “vim” unless you implement a tiny, honest subset (read-only viewer with vim-ish keys). A convincing alternative: view <doc> with /search, n next match, q quit. (Feels like less(1).)

[] changelog command: shows a dated changelog from a static file.

[] “Contact” done right on static hosting; Since no backend: contact prints: email (copy), calendly link (if you use it), and a prefilled mailto: subject template. Also provide a downloadable contact.vcf (vCard) file.Optional: pgp shows your PGP public key block (if you have one), or ssh shows GitHub SSH fingerprint. (Only if real.)


[] add llm friendly pages to the resume pdf, and terminal onboarding links.
[] guide agents when scraping the page (even when js is not enabled)
[] prepare an FS.llm.txt or json


[] different level of verbosity
    [] help --advanced
    [] help

[] files should be signed with my private key. and verifiable with my public key.

[] extract indexdb logics into separate module.

[] make the terminal a pwa (fully function offline)


[] blog posts should be interesting things about what I do, how I do, 
    how I think, what I think. not tech jargons and tutorials!
    Each blog post should be an opportunity to learn more about me.

[] ai command executioner?
     interpret the intention of the entered message; then suggest the closest command ?

     instruct a separate model for this task.

     also migrate the previous model to new user account.

They are desperate for:

AI systems that do not silently fail

AI systems that do not hallucinate in edge cases

AI systems that do not corrupt state over time

AI systems that can be audited, paused, rolled back

AI systems that won’t cause legal / financial incidents

This is already happening in:

fintech

infra tooling

dev productivity

internal copilots

autonomous ops / SRE tooling

The pain is post-MVP, post-demo, pre-scale.

Convey “production-grade engineer” without saying it

Operate like a real product: crisp loading states, optimistic UI with graceful fallback, retries with backoff, and clear error banners that show correlation IDs—implies familiarity with reliability patterns.

Show observability mindset: a tiny “live health” widget that surfaces uptime %, latency p50/p95, and a structured log snippet; links to a “status” page stub with incident history.

Demonstrate safe rollout habits: feature-flag toggle in the UI (stubbed) and a “deploy pipeline” timeline card describing build → tests → canary → full release; hints at CI/CD literacy.

Model failure handling: add a chaos button (“simulate outage”) that degrades the UI gracefully and displays how the system responds—recoverable paths inspire trust.

Highlight predictability: deterministic demo data (seeded), visible version string vX.Y.Z with changelog link, and “last build” timestamp; signals discipline.

Security cues: mention least-privilege and secret hygiene in a short “tech notes” sidebar; show redaction in logs by default.

Copy tone: concise, operational language—“built for uptime”, “tested before deploy”, “alerts before users notice”—rather than hype.

Performance proof: include a tiny benchmark card (e.g., “render <50ms on median device”) sourced from a recorded run.

If you want it to feel organic: weave these elements into the product UI (status chip, version, dry-run toggle, chaos test) instead of a “Hire me” banner; the behaviors themselves do the talking.
